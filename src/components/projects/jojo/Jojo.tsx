                    In this project I explored how emotional competence can be developed in children through open-ended play. I iteratively developed a play-kit that facilitates building characters with emotions, expressing emotions through storytelling and playing with parents,care-givers or older siblings. The play-kit was tested during the family day at i.d.e.a museum, Mesa AZ. It is now a part of an ongoing collaboration with Arizona State University, University of Southern California, Arizona local public schools and community colleges and several nonprofits.

                    From the onset of this project, I was curious to learn about the fundamentals of early childhood development and previous work on emotional competence of kids. During the first 2 weeks, I conducted secondary research on social emotional learning of preschoolers and created a visual summary of my learnings.

                    In parallel to conducting secondary research, I visited ASU Child Development Lab, a dedicated research facility and a day-care space for early childhood development to observe children during their outdoor open play time. Through courtroom style sketches, I documented my observations highlighting key elements of open-ended play.

                    Now with a strong understanding of the design challenge, I started to brainstorm forms that my toy can take. Being a visual thinker, I made a number of sketches as my mind wandered free.

                    I showed my initial sketches to Dena Milliron, the Education Curator of i.d.e.a museum, a major children’s museum in Arizona. Her feedback highlighted key concerns to be aware of when designing for preschoolers such as minimum dimensions to prevent choking.

                    After multiple rounds of prototyping, I organized a testing session at i.d.e.a museum with the help of colleagues.  I named my toy “Jojo”. We set up a table saying 'Come play with Jojo'. Children, parents and caretakers were given the opportunity to freely explore the material provided which include 3-D printed parts with magnets embedded, different sets of 'eyes' painted on turned wood shapes, wheel sets repurposed from old toys and Play Doh.

                    Throughout my exploration, I noted storytelling as an integral part of open-ended play. I observed kids and caretakers always bond around imaginary stories they share about the Jojo character they made.
                    Identifying storytelling as an opportunity to scaffold creative expression using Jojo, I designed a booklet with a story about different emotions of Jojo.

                <H3>What is the most important lesson I learned from this project?</H3>
                <ProjectP>
                    Most of my team members did not have prior experience in human
                    centered design. I learnt how to lead people from non-design
                    backgrounds in the HCD process.
                </ProjectP>

                <H3>What was the most challenging?</H3>
                <ProjectP>
                    Leading and managing a team remotely during COVID-19 and especially
                    while preparing for my PhD defense.
                </ProjectP>

                <H3>What would I do differently if I were to do this project again?</H3>
                <ProjectP>
                    I would plan out remote design sessions more thoughtfully. I would
                    love to try out Figma Jam.{" "}
