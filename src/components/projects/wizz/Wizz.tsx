        <ProjectP>
          For more than 90% of Sri Lankans, English is not their first language. Yet, it is a vital skill to progress in many careers. Across the country, there are significant barriers to access affordable and effective English learning.
          In 2020, we helped a young ed-tech startup address this problem and create a mobile learning platform for career-focused English.
        </ProjectP>

        <H3>My Role</H3>
        <ProjectP>
          I primarily led the design research, content strategy and visual strategy processes. Collaborating with a
          language expert, an interaction designer, a developer and English teachers we developed a functional prototype of the platform for hand-off.

        <ProjectH2>Context and Starting Brief</ProjectH2>
        <ProjectP>
          A young Sri Lankan startup which entered the English e-learning market a few years ago wanted to rethink the user experience of
          their existing mobile app as they were failing to retain users and completion rates were very low.

        <ProjectH2>Conducting secondary research and qualitative interviews </ProjectH2>
        <ProjectP>
          We started by exploring the motivations of the Sri Lankans for learning English and the barriers they are facing. We reviewed a large body of previous research
          findings and conducted rapid guirilla interviews with 6 participants selected through convenience sampling.

        <H2>Reframing the problem</H2>
        <ProjectP>
          We uncovered that peoplesâ€™ motivations to learn English significantly
          relates to their aspirations to excel in their careers, from finding a
          good job to getting promoted frequently. With this insight, we
          redefined the brief to focus on building a learning platform that
          helps people to learn career-focused English skills.

          Our team explored the many facets of the design problem using the following subproblems. I led qualitative interviews with industry segments, explored English learning essentials with teachers,
          structured new content, and developed a new visual style.

        <H2>Creating a visual communication system that is culturally familiar and safe </H2>
        <ProjectP>
          We wanted to create a visual communication system that supported a joyful learning experience. In order to achieve this
          it was important that the elements and styles we used provided a comfortable and familiar visual landscape. We also developed an icon system that denoted
          the different lesson segments - grammar, vocabulary etc - in lieu of written terms, as these terms often have prior stigma associated with them.

          Our next challenge was to translate the outcomes of our design
          exploration into a mobile app based learning experience. So we
          conducted multiple wireframe design and paper prototyping sessions and
          iteratively developed them into a refined mobile app design.

        <H2>Designing a microinteraction for translation</H2>
        <ProjectP>
          Our next challenge was to make sure that learners got meaningful translation support.
          We wanted to find the sweet spot where they would understand the content in their native language, and yet be pushed to read and comprehend in English.
          For this we explored what a microinteraction for translation might look and work like.

          Finally I handed off the Figma workspace to the developer to create a  \functional prototype to present to the client. 
          The goal of this prototype was to demonstrate the new app design and lesson strategy during investor presentations.

        <H2>Reflections</H2>
        <H3>What is the most important lesson I learned from this project?</H3>
        <ProjectP>
        I learnt how to translate research findings into a business strategy and then translate that into visual and content strategies. This process helped me understand the different mindsets I need to have when switching between roles. 

        </ProjectP>

        <H3>What was the most challenging?</H3>
        <ProjectP>
        Conducting remote interviews across time zones while doing my full-time masters.

        </ProjectP>

        <H3>What would I do differently if I were to do this project again?</H3>
        <ProjectP>
        I would explore more visual styles at the beginning of the project and test them out with the target user group.
