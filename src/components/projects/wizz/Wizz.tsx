        <ProjectP>
          For more than 90% of Sri Lankans, English is not their first language. Yet, it is a vital skill to progress in many careers. Across the country, there are significant barriers to access affordable and effective English learning.
          In 2020, we helped a young ed-tech startup address this problem and create a mobile learning platform for career-focused English.
        </ProjectP>

        <H3>My Role</H3>
        <ProjectP>
          I primarily led the design research, content strategy and visual strategy processes. Collaborating with a UX researcher,
          language expert, English teachers and a visual designer, we developed a functional prototype of the platform for hand-off.

        <ProjectH2>Context and Starting Brief</ProjectH2>
        <ProjectP>
          A young Sri Lankan startup which entered the English e-learning market a few years ago wanted to rethink the user experience of
          their existing mobile app as they were failing to retain users and completion rates were very low.

        <ProjectH2>Conducting secondary research and qualitative interviews </ProjectH2>
        <ProjectP>
          We started by exploring the motivations of the Sri Lankans for learning English and the barriers they are facing. We reviewed a large body of previous research
          findings and conducted rapid guirilla interviews with 6 participants selected through convenience sampling.

        <H2>Reframing the problem</H2>
        <ProjectP>
          We uncovered that peoplesâ€™ motivations to learn English significantly
          relates to their aspirations to excel in their careers, from finding a
          good job to getting promoted frequently. With this insight, we
          redefined the brief to focus on building a learning platform that
          helps people to learn career-focused English skills.

          Our team explored the many facets of the design problem using the following subproblems. I led qualitative interviews with industry segments, explored English learning essentials with teachers,
          structured new content, and developed a new visual style.

        <H2>Creating a visual communication system that is culturally familiar and safe </H2>
        <ProjectP>
          We wanted to create a visual communication system that supported a joyful learning experience. In order to achieve this
          it was important that the elements and styles we used provided a comfortable and familiar visual landscape. We also developed an icon system that denoted
          the different lesson segments - grammar, vocabulary etc - in lieu of written terms, as these terms often have prior stigma associated with them.

          Our next challenge was to translate the outcomes of our design
          exploration into a mobile app based learning experience. So we
          conducted multiple wireframe design and paper prototyping sessions and
          iteratively developed them into a refined mobile app design.

        <H2>Designing a microinteraction for translation</H2>
        <ProjectP>
          Our next challenge was to make sure that learners got meaningful translation support.
          We wanted to find the sweet spot where they would understand the content in their native language, and yet be pushed to read and comprehend in English.
          For this we explored what a microinteraction for translation might look and work like.

        <H2>Developing a functional prototype of the app</H2>
        <ProjectP>
          Then I developed a functional app prototype with a selected set of
          features using React Native and Spring/Java. The goal of this
          prototype was to demonstrate the new app design and lesson strategy
          during investor presentations.

        <H3>What is the most important lesson I learned from this project?</H3>
        <ProjectP>
          Most of my team members did not have prior experience in human
          centered design. I learnt how to lead people from non-design
          backgrounds in the HCD process.
        </ProjectP>

        <H3>What was the most challenging?</H3>
        <ProjectP>
          Leading and managing a team remotely during COVID-19 and especially
          while preparing for my PhD defense.
        </ProjectP>

        <H3>What would I do differently if I were to do this project again?</H3>
        <ProjectP>
          I would plan out remote design sessions more thoughtfully. I would
          love to try out Figma Jam.{" "}
