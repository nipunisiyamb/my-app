         USA, a leading mobile service provider, to explore their late-payment\n          problem. Here we incorporated a human centered design approach and\n          conducted a series of interviews, ideation sessions and co-creation\n          sessions with multiple stakeholders including late payers, on-time\n          payers and T-mobile top management. In the end we came up with 6\n          long-term strategic directions for T-mobile to reduce their\n          late-payments by 50% within the next 5 years.\n        </ProjectP>\n        <H3>Team</H3>\n        <ProjectP>\n          I worked with two interaction designers (Tiffany Eaton and Xuan Song),\n          a design researcher (Maher Kelifi), an innovation consultant(Prof.\n          Haakon Faste) and a behavioral economist (Dr. David Fetherstonhaugh).\n        </ProjectP>\n\n        <H3>My Role</H3>\n        <ProjectP>\n          From the outset, I was involved in research planning and conducting\n          user interviews and co-design activities with my teammates. In the\n          latter part of the process, I led the prototyping of design concepts\n          generated within our ideation sessions.\n        </ProjectP>\n        <H3>Duration</H3>\n        <ProjectP>2 months (June 2018 - July 2018)</ProjectP>\n      </SummerySection>\n\n      <ContentSection>\n        <H2> The Design Challenge</H2>\n        <ProjectP>\n          T-Mobile has a bill payment problem: every month, nearly 40% of its\n          nearly 75 million customers are late on their bill.\n        </ProjectP>\n      </ContentSection>\n      <CaptionedImage imageSrc={problemImage} caption={\"\"}></CaptionedImage>\n\n      <ContentSection>\n        <H2>Understanding the T-mobile Ecosystem</H2>\n        <ProjectP>\n          We spent the first two weeks of the project to understand the T-mobile\n          business ecosystem. We had multiple conversations with T-mobile from\n          VPs to outlet managers.

As part of this initiative, we hosted cross- studio meetups called ‘Play Dates’ where students were encouraged to freely experiment or ‘play test’ each other’s prototypes and share feedback.\n        </ProjectP>\n      </ContentSection>\n      <CaptionedImage caption={\"\"} imageSrc={collaborationImage}></CaptionedImage>\n\n      <ContentSection>\n        <H2>Reducing the stigma surrounding industrial design prototyping</H2>\n        <ProjectP>\n          Industrial design prototyping is often associated with hard materials and high-skill processes such as foam modeling, CNC milling and 3D printing. After having lost access to these facilities and knowledge during the pandemic, I noticed that students were struggling to give their ideas a physical form. Furthermore, students refrained from prototyping until their ideas were finalized, due to fear of failure.\n          Therefore, I wanted to re-introduce prototyping as\n          an act of experimentation; something you can fail at with very little consequences. </ProjectP>\n        <ProjectP>\n          The first step was to make Lego bricks, PlayDoh, craft paper, origami sheets - simple materials you’d play with in kindergarten - readily available in the studio. For this we prototyped\n          a ‘Play Station,’ a space where students could easily access these materials and also share their prototypes for asynchronous feedback.\n        </ProjectP>\n        <ProjectP>\n          Second, I used extracts from Doug Stowe’s work,\n          the Wisdom of the Hands, and Stuart Brown’s Play: How it Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and Invigorates the Soul to discuss the benefits of playful prototyping with the students.        </ProjectP>\n      </ContentSection>\n      <CaptionedImage caption={\"\"} imageSrc={playStationImage}></CaptionedImage>\n\n    </ProjectContainer>\n  );\n}\n","/Users/nipunisiyambalapitiya/Documents/Portfolio/porfolio_v3/my-app/src/components/projects/swlc/SWLC.tsx",["300","301","302","303"],"import React from \"react\";\nimport styled from \"styled-components\";\nimport { colorTheme, H1, H2, H3 } from \"../../../theme/Styles\";\nimport CaptionedImage from \"../../ui/captionedImage/CaptionedImage\";\nimport {\n  ContentSection,\n  HeroImage,\n  ProjectContainer,\n  ProjectP,\n  SummerySection,\n  VideoContainer,\n} from \"../styles\";\nimport { SWLCData } from \"./SWLCData\";\nimport heromockup from \"./assets/hero_mockup.png\";\nimport projectbrief from \"./assets/projectbrief.svg\";\nimport interviewguide from \"./assets/interview_guide.jpg\";\nimport initialwireframes from \"./assets/initial_wireframes.png\";\nimport codesign from \"./assets/co_design.png\";\nimport borrow from \"./assets/borrow.png\";\nimport exploration from \"./assets/exploration.svg\";\nimport usertesting from\"./assets/user_testing.png\";\nimport webmockup from \"./assets/web_mockups.png\";\n\nimport TopBar from \"../../ui/topBar/TopBar\";\nimport { devices } from \"../../../theme/devices\";\nimport FullwidthImage from \"../../ui/fullwidthImage/FullwidthImage\";\n\nconst Title = styled(H1)`\n  width: 52vw;\n  margin-bottom:1.5vw;\n  color:#F48149;\n  @media ${devices.mobile} {\n    width: 75vw;\n  }\n`;\n\nconst Frame = styled.img`\n  width: 50vw;\n  height: auto;\n  margin: auto;\n  margin: 5vw 20vw;\n  text-align: center;\n`;\n\nconst FrameContainer = styled.div`\n  width: 90vw;\n  background-color: ${colorTheme.lightGrey};\n  margin: auto;\n  margin-bottom: 8vw;\n`;\n\n\nexport default function SWLC(props: {}) {\n  return (\n    <ProjectContainer>\n      <TopBar></TopBar>\n      <HeroImage src={SWLCData.heroImage}></HeroImage>\n      <SummerySection>\n        <Title>{SWLCData.title}</Title>\n        <ProjectP>\n          In the summer of 2021 we helped Southwest Lending Closet, a\n          non-profit organization that lends home health equipment for free, rethink how they can better serve the public\n          by improving their digital presence.
